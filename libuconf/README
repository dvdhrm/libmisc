This package contains libraries and applications to work with universal config

See the manpage uconf(3) for an introduction of the API.

== Dependencies ==

This library uses the "cstr" library for string handling. See:
	http://gibhut.com/dvdhrm/libcstr
for further information on libcstr. It should be installed into your system. If
you want to link it statically, edit ./Makefile and edit the paths.

== Install ==

Run
	make build
to build the library.
Run
	make install
to install the library and manpages into your system. Default prefix is /usr but
you can change that with:

Run
	make uninstall PREFIX=/usr
to remove the library from your system. Default prefix is again /usr and should
be changed if you changed it during install.
