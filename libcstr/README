= Static C Arrays and Strings Library =

This library provides the "cstr" datatype, which can be used to operate on
binary C strings which do not suffer from the classic C-string restriction to
not contain binary zero characters.

See the manpage cstr(3) for an introduction to the cstr library.

= Requirements =

No other libraries are required. However, this library uses some C99 features so
it might not compile with C89-only compilers.

= Install =

Run
	make build
to build the library.
Run
	make install
to install the library and manpages into your system. Default prefix is /usr but
you can change that with:
	make install PREFIX=/usr
Run
	make uninstall PREFIX=/usr
to remove the library from your system. Default prefix is again /usr and should
be changed if you changed it during install.

= License =

This library is written by David Herrmann <dh.herrmann@googlemail.com> 2011 and
the whole distribution is dedicated to the Public Domain.

= Todo =

Stuff that is still to be done:
	- write cstr_cmp manpage
	- write CSTR_STATIC manpage
	- write CSTR_DYNAMIC manpage
	- write CSTR_LVALUE manpage
	- write cstr_cpy manpage
