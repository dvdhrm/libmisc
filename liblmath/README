= Linear Math Library =

This is a very simple linear math library. It has a clean C API and the
datatypes are created to be binary compatible with other math libraries. This
library is optimized for use with OpenGL. Other applications will not find it
very useful as its functionality is quite limited.

For asm-optimized or numerical accurate math calculations, please use libraries
like GNU MP (www.gmplib.org) or GNU GSL (www.gnu.org/s/gsl). However, for best
compatibilty with OpenGL, this library provides a clean and easy API for all
needed matrix and vector manipulations.

There are many C++ math libraries for OpenGL applications out there, but I never
found one with a clean C API so I decide to write my own.

= Requirements =

No other libraries are required. However, this library uses some C99 features so
it might not compile with C89-only compilers.

= Install =

Run
	make build
to build the library.
Run
	make install
to install the library and manpages into your system. Default prefix is /usr but
you can change that with:
	make install PREFIX=/usr
Run
	make uninstall PREFIX=/usr
to remove the library from your system. Default prefix is again /usr and should
be changed if you changed it during install.
